# Learning React With Colt Steele!
After taking my first [course with Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) on web development, I'm starting to feel pretty comfortable with HTML/CSS/Javascript as well as using Mongo (admittedly need to brush up on that), Node.js, and Express to build a full stack app (maybe I should ad a link to the YelpCamp project here). So, if I were to build a site using just those... that'd be a MEN stack? Something about that just doesn't seem right :pause_button:. I think what's more common is a MERN stack and I'm missing the R for React! 

To complete the loop I'll be taking [another Colt Steele Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-bootcamp/) on React! This will be my first time learning a framework and I've heard React is a good place to start. Per the description, this course will use a variety of exercises, projects, and games to teach me how to use the React framework to build and maintain modular JavaScript code with ease!

Here are some highlights (taken from the course description): 

* Learn React, from the very basics up to advanced topics like Next JS, React Router, Higher Order Components and Hooks and the Context API.

* Build one massive capstone application, complete with drag & drop, animations, route transitions, complex form validations, and more.

* Learn the latest in React, including Hooks (my favorite part of React!).  We build a complete app using Hooks, including multiple custom hooks.

* Learn state management using the useContext and useReducer hooks, to mimic some of the functionality of Redux.

## Intro
What will I be using this readme file for? 

After each section I plan to summarize what I've learned, explain what exercises I did, and keep track of any notes or questions that may come up along the way

I think this will greatly help my memory retention, as well as serve as a reference which I can always come back to. I also expect it to make it easier to explain what I've learned to others in the future (job interview? :wink:)

## Section 1: A Taste of React

### Intro to React
I start off by learning... what is React? It is a powerful **front-end framework/library** that makes it easy to use and reuse "view components" and makes it easier to build modular applications! In react, we "encapsulate" logic and HTML into a *class* that can be shared across documents.

### Framework or Library?
Apparently there are some discussion around if React is a framework or a library, but before we get into that let's first talk about what a **front-end framework** even is.

Key characteristics:

* Larger JS Libraries
* Provide "blueprint" for apps
* "Opinionated", meaning they have guidelines for how you should design an app
* they often provide for code re-use
* They also often provide templating for HTML

What are some popular frameworks rn? Angular, Ember, Vue, **React**, **Next.js**

Now, let's get back to the question of "is React a framework or library?" Colt's opinion is that React *by itself* is a library, however people rarely use it on it's own. React is usually combined with things like React Router, Webpack, etc. making the "React Ecosystem" a framework in it's own right. Side note: Next.js is actually a framework built around React!
